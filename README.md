# NOTICE

This package is officially deprecated.

The directories here that are submodules are the packages I think are 
useful enough to warrant maintainership. They are all their own repos 
and have been uploaded to hackage separately. In accordance with this, 
the [yesod-comments][] package on hackage now directly depends on them 
and not this meta-package.

[yesod-comments]: https://github.com/pbrisbin/yesod-comments "Yesod Comments"

Everyone should switch to using those packages independently and not 
rely on, expect, or link to the "-goodies" meta package.

That said, if anyone thinks an overall -meta is useful and is willing to 
maintain it, I won't stop you -- feel free to fork, update and upload.
